# Project Abstract
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a form of neural
network that uses two agents to generate synthetic examples that
resemble real-world examples. The purpose of this report is to implement GANs through a basic example reproducing and populating
the sine function, and to produce synthetic handwritten digits using
the MNIST dataset. The primary objective was to learn, implement
and demonstrate that GANs can be used to generate artificial data.
The experiments demonstrated that a simple GAN could populate and
approximate the underlying structure of sparse periodic data, while
a conditional deep convolutional GAN could produce realistic image
samples with a large, structured dataset. Visual evaluation showed
that the generated output retained the essential features of the training data, with fidelity improving as the size of the dataset and the architectural complexity increased. Overall, this implementation illustrates the core adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
future work applying generative models in practical data science contexts.
