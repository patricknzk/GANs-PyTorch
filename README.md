# Project Abstract
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a form of neural net
work that uses two agents to generate synthetic examples that resem
ble real-world examples. The purpose of this report is to implement
 GANs through a basic example reproducing the sine function, and to
 apply the same model to a dataset retrieved from Kaggle relating the
 perceived levels of anxiety and depression in students. The primary
 objective was to explore whether GAN could be applied to augment
 data in a low-resource setting. The results demonstrate that GAN was
 able to generate synthesised data that closely resembled the original
 dataset. The synthetic data generated by the GAN is statistically con
sistent with the real dataset and can be effectively used for additional
 modelling tasks such as predictive modelling.
